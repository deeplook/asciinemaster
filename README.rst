Asciinemaster contains some experiments to add features to drive Asciinema.

* Free software: GNU General Public License v3
* Documentation: https://asciinemaster.readthedocs.io.

This will take a shell-like script, iterate over its commands, execute them,
and record the commands and their respective output as an Asciinema.org (v2)
screencast.

Later, it will also take a shell-like script and the generated screencast
from it, re-execute the script and compare the new screencast to the old one
for testing purposes.
